Overview
========

Labs
####
There are 8 + 1 labs in this course.
You'll learn how to **design** a kernel by **implementing** it yourself.

There are 2 types of exercises in each lab.

================== ===========================================================================================
``basic``          You're required to implement it by the description, they take up major of your scores.
``advanced``       You can implement some of them to get a bonus.
================== ===========================================================================================

.. important::

  You must finish todos in exercises to get scores.

There is no limitation on which programming language you should use for the labs.
However, there are a lot of things that are language-dependent and even compiler-dependent.
You need to manage them yourself.

You can check last year's `course website <https://oscapstone.github.io/osc2022>`_ 
and `submission repository <https://github.com/oscapstone/osc2022>`_ to see what you might need
to do during this semester.
Yet, the requirements and descriptions may differ this semester.

Grading Policy
##############

It's allowed and recommended to check others code, but you still need to write it on your own
instead of copy/paste.

TAs validate plagiarism by asking for the detail of your implementation.
If you can't elaborate your code clearly, you only get 50% of the score.

Your code may work on an emulator even it's wrong.
Hence, you get 90% of the score if your code works on QEMU but not on real rpi3.

For late hand-in, the penalty is 1% per week.

.. important::
   Remember to create a Pull Request to `oscapstone/osc2023 <https://github.com/oscapstone/osc2023>`_
   before you demo and make sure the TA merge the PR after finishing demo.
   It is an evidance to show that you have finished your homework in time.

Disclaimer
##########
We're not kernel developers or experienced embedded system developers.
Commonly, we made mistakes in the description.
If you find any of them, send an issue or PR to `this GitHub repo <https://github.com/oscapstone/oscapstone.github.io>`_.
